# **Instructions for how to run the project locally** 

This project requires [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable), and [chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

To get our project running:
1. Clone our repo by running `git clone https://github.com/CEN-3031-Group-2b/Sapphire-Project14-2b.git`.
2. Navigate to `/client/` and run `yarn install` then `yarn start`.
3. Navigate back to `/`  and run `docker compose up` to start the Docker container.
3. Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

Our project did not require implementing private keys or new accounts. To access our features, connect to [localhost:3000/sandbox](http://localhost:3000/sandbox) or log in to any student account and assignment.

All code we have implemented has been pushed to the `develop` branch. There are no in-progress features.
